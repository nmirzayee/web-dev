        Today I started learning HTML. I learned about basic tags like
        headings, paragraphs, images, and links. I also learned how
        to structure a webpage using proper HTML elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        It feels exciting to create my first webpage and actually see
        something appear in the browser.

        This week I started learning CSS. I learned how to change colors,
        fonts, spacing, and layout. CSS makes websites look much better
        than plain HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        My favorite part so far is changing fonts and improving readability
        using line height and font styles.
